      <h1>All About Sharks</h1>
      <p>Sharks are fascinating creatures that have roamed the Earth's oceans for millions of years. They are known for their powerful presence and crucial role in marine ecosystems.</p>

      <h2>Where Can Sharks Be Found?</h2>
      <p>Sharks inhabit a wide range of marine environments, from shallow coastal waters to the open ocean and even some freshwater systems. Their distribution varies greatly by species:</p>

      <h3>Coastal Waters</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Nurse Sharks:</strong> Often found in warm, shallow waters of the Atlantic and Pacific, near coral reefs and mangroves.</li>
        <li><strong>Lemon Sharks:</strong> Prefer shallow, subtropical waters, often seen in estuaries and bays along the U.S. Atlantic coast and in the Caribbean.</li>
        <li><strong>Blacktip Reef Sharks:</strong> Common in the shallow, clear waters around coral reefs in the Indo-Pacific.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Open Ocean (Pelagic)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Great White Sharks:</strong> Found in cool, temperate waters worldwide, often near coastlines with seal and sea lion populations.</li>
        <li><strong>Mako Sharks:</strong> Inhabit temperate and tropical offshore waters around the globe, known for their speed.</li>
        <li><strong>Whale Sharks:</strong> The largest fish in the world, found in tropical and warm-temperate waters globally, filter-feeding in the open ocean.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Deep Sea</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Greenland Sharks:</strong> Live in the cold, deep waters of the North Atlantic and Arctic oceans, known for their extreme longevity.</li>
        <li><strong>Frilled Sharks:</strong> A deep-sea species found in scattered locations in the Atlantic and Pacific, typically near the seabed.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Freshwater (Rare)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Bull Sharks:</strong> Unique among sharks for their ability to tolerate freshwater. They are found in rivers and lakes worldwide, as well as coastal marine environments.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Shark Habitats and Adaptations</h2>
      <p>Sharks have adapted to their diverse habitats with incredible precision. Their streamlined bodies, acute senses (including an extraordinary sense of smell and electroreception), and specialized feeding mechanisms allow them to thrive in various niches.</p>
      <p>Coral reefs provide abundant prey and shelter for many smaller shark species, while the open ocean demands adaptations for long-distance travel and hunting migratory prey. Deep-sea sharks, on the other hand, have evolved to survive in cold, high-pressure environments with limited food sources.</p>
      <p>Understanding shark habitats is crucial for their conservation, as many species face threats from overfishing, habitat destruction, and climate change.</p>
