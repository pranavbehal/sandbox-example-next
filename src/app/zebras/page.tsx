        <h1>Zebras</h1>
        <p>Zebras are several species of African equids (horse family) united by their distinctive black-and-white striped coats. There are three species of zebras: the plains zebra, the Gr√©vy's zebra and the mountain zebra. Zebras' stripes come in different patterns, unique to each individual. Several theories have been proposed for the function of these stripes, with most evidence supporting them as a form of protection from biting flies. Zebras are generally social animals that live in small harems to large herds. Unlike their closest relatives, horses and donkeys, zebras have never been truly domesticated. </p>
